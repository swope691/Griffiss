<h1>“Live Unafraid, Die Strong.”</h1>
      <p>
        A simple phrase, synonymous with other phrases but this one rings true.
        I’ve been involved in plenty of harrowing situations where it was “me or the bad guy” as a police officer.
        Very quickly I realized peak physical wellness was vital, not only in life or death situations but in everyday life as well.
        Never have I been afraid of danger, in that I personally study “Odinism” or Norse Mythology. Vikings knew their destiny so they lived and died unafraid and strong.
        This lifestyle is what I wanted to instill in others.
        Steps by me were taken to promote combat preparedness and fitness in the county I patrolled by opening a free weight lifting class.
        This sparked my interest in powerlifting and assisting others to achieve greatness. With some study I rapidly grew in size and strength,
        learning what I could from fitness pros like Jay Cutler, Kai Greene, Jim Stoppani and the like. In time I gained a handful of endorsements to competitively lift.
        While I never placed in my competitions I learned so much from men and women above me. I took that experience and molded it into what you see today…
        The Iron Viking brand is here and I plan to outfit everyone in the best gym gear around!
